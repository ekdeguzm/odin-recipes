    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2> 
    <p>One of my favorite comfort foods, a piping hot bowl of pho is a tradition to have everytime I return home. The foundation is the broth, rich with spices simmered on low with beef for hours. Silky rice noodles added to a broth filled with the flavors of ginger, coriander, cinnimon, tendon, tripe. The bowl is topped with basil, bean sprouts, thai chilis, japanenos, lime, cilantro,and green onion, bringing a crisp freshness to the base of the soup. Eating pho makes me happy and brings peace to my world. </p>
