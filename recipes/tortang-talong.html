    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2> 
    <p>One of my favorite childhood dishes, and delicious with a bowl of white rice, the tortang talong is a dish that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A charred flavor complemented with the freshness of kalamansi (lime) and tomatos, it is a unique expression of a 'savory vegetable'.</div></p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
      <ul>
          <li>4 medium eggplants</li>
          <li>6 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
          <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
          <li>5 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 lime, 1 tomato</li>
          <li>salt and black pepper</li>
          <li>soy sauce</li>
          <li>fish sauce</li>
          <li>Cooked white rice, serve alongside</li>

      </ul>

      <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Turn on the stove to medium heat. Poke four 1/2-inch slits in each eggplant. Roast the eggplants one-by-one ontop of the fire until the skin is chared and fully tender, offering little resistance when pierced with a knife. </li>
        <li>Peel eggplant discarding skin and stems. With a fork, pressdown firmly on each eggplant along its length until it looks like a large teardrop.</li>
        <li>Heat up large pan, add 2 tablespoons of oil on medium heat. Add onions and garlic and saute. Add soysauce, salt, black pepper, and fish sauce and stir until the seasonings are absorbed.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat all eggs and add the sauted mixture and mix.</li>
        <li>Clean pan, add oil and heat with medium flame.</li>
        <li>Dip the eggplants in bowl one-by-one and add into the frying pan  </li>
        <li>Fry it up, add salt, pepper, soysauce, and fish sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>When cooked, move it to a place with white rice, ketchup on the side, and sliced limes and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!!</li>
